This is an application that controls a simple positioning robot used to assist
calibrating the IMU modules.

Architecture:

The robot is a set of Robotis Dynamixel AX-12 servos that can hold and move an
IMU sensor.

It is controlled by an Arduino Uno like device (actual device used is
Freetronics Ether Ten).

The Arduino runs an ethernet connection that takes requests to position the arm
via a simple web service.

eg http://10.1.1.98:8085/pos/2

from commandline try:

    while true
        do wget -O /dev/null http://10.1.1.98:8085/step
        sleep 2
    done


See robot.h for ethernet address and port.


Programming:
    make clean (or reset or upload)

    may need to remove dynamixel control wires from arduino when programming
    for some weird interference issue when programming
