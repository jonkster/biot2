To use this module, add the following to the project Makefile:

    DIRS += ../common/housekeeper/
    USEMODULE += biot_housekeeper

and in code that wants to use the housekeeping functionality,

1. include the header:

#include ../common/housekeeper/housekeeper.h

2. Implement a idleTask method that will be called repeatedly by the housekeeper when nothing else happening:

void idleTask(void)
{
    ...
}

3. start the housekeeping thread:

thread_create(housekeeping_stack, sizeof(housekeeping_stack), PRIO, THREAD_CREATE_STACKTEST, housekeeping_handler,
                NULL, "housekeeping");
