*Biotz IMU Node*

This is a small device, currently consisting of a samr21b18-mz210pa board, an
MPU9250 IMU device and associated leds, battery, charging circuit etc.

It communicates using 6lowPAN with a router, sending orientation information
calculated from the IMU readings to the router.

1.  if IMU device doesn't start properly when board boots up, I have noticed it
started after changing the position of programmer cable that was near the atsam
board on the device.  Wondering if it is sensitive to electrical interference?

2. If node randomly crashes with stack overflow - first thing to try is
changing thread stack size allocation to try and increase it (NB may be hard to
know which thread needs adjusting - a bit of trial and error).

3. now experimenting with using MPU9255 device instead of MPU9250
