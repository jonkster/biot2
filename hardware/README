when designing board in KiCad

1. set origin at suitable point near bottom left of board

2. Plot KiCad board (in Gerber Format)


pcb2gcode
---------

don't use vectorial core (due thickness of cutting tool)

Backside mirroring = Y axis

Milling depth -0.1mm
200 mm/min horiz speed
drill depth -3.0mm
    mill holes, use single bit (0.8mm?)

outline 0.8mm
-2.5mm depth
horiz speed 100mm/min
max single pass depth 1mm





CNC
--------

When first starting up CNC (or if need to drill reference/holding holes in a
fresh PCB)

1. jog Y axis so spindle clear of clamps when X homes

2. Home all axes

3. Set Touch Off on X and Y to initialise starting point (important if drilling
   reference marks for new PCB)

4. bring drill close to work surface and touch off Z   


Tools
-----

Currently using 0.8mm end mill


Milling PCB
-------------

After exporting gcode from pcb2gcode application:

1. load BACK surface gcode

1. jog spindle to suitable point on PCB

2. touch off X and Y (and if necessary bring Z close to surface and touch off Z)
   (may need to rejog at this point to get outline at a suitable point)

3. run BACK gcode (will prompt for auto level probe etc)

4. G0 X0, G0 Y0 to bring drill back to origin and drill a reference hole

5. flip board and load FRONT gcode

6. Jog X until it lines up with the reference hole exactly

7. touch off X

7. run FRONT gcode

8. load and run drill gcode

9. load and run outline gcode
