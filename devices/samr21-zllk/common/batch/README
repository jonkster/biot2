This module allows you to call programatically a RIOTOS shell command.

To use this module, add the following to the project Makefile:

    DIRS += ../common/batch/
    USEMODULE += biot_batch

and in code that uses the batch method, include the header

    #include ../common/batch/batch.h

An example of calling a command in 'batch mode':

    batch(shell_commands, "ifconfig 2 add affe::2");
